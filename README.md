# Urban Forestry Assessment

This repository offers an introductory exploration of urban forestry by analyzing a tree inventory dataset for the City of Alameda. This repository contains the following components:

1. **Species-Based Water Use Ratings Visualization:** Explore the distribution of trees in the inventory across different water use rating categories based on species. This visualization provides a basic understanding of water consumption patterns among various tree species.

2. **Canopy Cover Map for Census Tracts:** Visualize the canopy cover percentage for different census tracts in the City of Alameda. Canopy cover refers to the percent of area within a given boundary that is covered by treesâ€™ leaves and branches from a birds-eye view.

3. **Total Canopy Area Calculation Function:** Utilize a simple function to calculate the total canopy area (in square feet) for the entire tree inventory. The calculation is based on the assumption that all tree canopies are perfect circles.
